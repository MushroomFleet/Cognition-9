# Multi-Agent Orchestration System

A production-ready multi-agent orchestration system using Claude Code's native custom agent capabilities (v1.0.60+).

## Overview

This project implements a supervisor pattern with three specialized agents:
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates complex multi-step workflows
- **Researcher**: Gathers and analyzes information from multiple sources
- **Writer**: Synthesizes research into well-structured documents

## Setup Verification

Run the test script to verify your setup:

```bash
python tests/test-orchestration.py
```

Expected output:
```
âœ… Project structure: READY
âœ… Agent definitions: CREATED (3 agents)
âœ… Orchestration flow: DESIGNED
```

## How to Use

### Basic Workflow

1. **Request a task**: Provide your request to the orchestrator agent
2. **Task decomposition**: Orchestrator analyzes and breaks down the task
3. **Delegation**: Orchestrator delegates subtasks to specialist agents
4. **Quality review**: Orchestrator reviews specialist outputs
5. **Synthesis**: Final output is integrated and delivered

### Example Task

```
User: "Research and write a comprehensive guide on Python async/await"

Orchestrator will:
1. Delegate research to researcher agent
   â†’ Output: artifacts/async-research.md
2. Delegate writing to writer agent
   â†’ Output: artifacts/async-tutorial.md
3. Review and synthesize
   â†’ Final: artifacts/final-output.md
```

## Agent Descriptions

### Orchestrator
- **Purpose**: Coordinates multi-agent workflows
- **Tools**: Read, Write, List_Files
- **Model**: Opus
- **Use when**: You need to coordinate complex multi-step work

### Researcher
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive information gathering and analysis
- **Tools**: Read, Web_Search, Grep
- **Model**: Opus
- **Use when**: You need thorough research from multiple sources

### Writer
- **Purpose**: Content synthesis and technical writing
- **Tools**: Read, Write
- **Model**: Opus
- **Use when**: You need well-structured documents from research

## Quality Standards

All agent outputs must meet these criteria:
- **Completeness**: All requirements addressed
- **Accuracy**: Information is correct and well-sourced
- **Clarity**: Clear, well-structured communication
- **Coherence**: Logical flow and organization
- **Format**: Proper markdown with consistent styling

## Communication Protocol

Agents communicate through markdown artifacts:
- Each agent reads inputs from `artifacts/`
- Each agent writes outputs to `artifacts/`
- Orchestrator reviews all artifacts for quality
- Feedback loops ensure quality threshold (80%) is met

## Next Steps

After completing Stage 1, proceed to:

1. **Stage 2**: Core Patterns & Observability
   - Implement parallel, sequential, and hub-and-spoke patterns
   - Add CRITIC pattern for tool-based validation
   - Set up comprehensive monitoring

2. **Stage 3**: Cybernetic Architecture
   - Implement Viable System Model (VSM) hierarchy
   - Add emergence patterns and homeostasis
   - Build skill library for pattern reuse

3. **Stage 4**: Novel Architectures (Optional)
   - Explore adaptive resonance orchestration
   - Implement stigmergic coordination
   - Experiment with cutting-edge patterns

4. **Stage 5**: Production Deployment
   - Add durable execution and checkpointing
   - Implement security infrastructure
   - Deploy with API layer and cost management
