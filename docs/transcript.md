Cybernetics began as science's most
0:03
ambitious attempt to explain everything
0:05
alive or automated, but then promptly
0:07
mutated into a dystopian fever dream.
0:10
So, how the hell did we end up here?
0:13
This innocent concept was born in the
0:15
late 1940s when MIT mathematician
0:18
Norbert Weiner noticed that
0:20
anti-aircraft guns and the human nervous
0:22
system had the same principle at work.
0:25
When an anti-aircraft gun tries to shoot
0:27
down a fastmoving plane can just aim at
0:30
where the plane is in that moment
0:32
because by the time the shell reaches
0:34
that point, the plane will have moved.
0:36
The gun has to predict where the plane
0:38
will be and aim there instead.
0:41
Weer realized that the human brain works
0:43
in a remarkably similar way. For
0:45
example, when you catch a ball, your
0:48
eyes and brain not only track where the
0:50
ball is right now, but also they
0:52
estimate where the ball is going to be.
0:55
He realized you could describe this
0:57
process, biological or mechanical, using
1:00
a single principle, feedback. The brain,
1:04
the thermostat, the economy, the
1:06
predator prey system, all looped back on
1:09
themselves, correcting error through
1:11
information. It was like finding a
1:14
universal language that both neurons and
1:16
machines already spoke. It's all about
1:18
messages between man and machines, man
1:20
and man, and between machine and
1:23
machine. Cybernetics basically explains
1:25
how we domesticate chaos. The Earth's
1:28
biosphere itself is one such gigantic
1:31
feedback. What James Lovelock called the
1:33
Gaia hypothesis. The planet breathes,
1:36
sweats, freezes, and thaws to keep
1:39
itself marginally habitable. It's
1:42
cybernetics on a planetary scale with
1:45
every species acting as a sensor and
1:48
actuator. Even consciousness can be seen
1:50
as a higher order feedback loop. After
1:53
all, awareness is life's most
1:55
sophisticated form of anti-entropy. The
1:58
word cybernetics comes from the Greek
2:01
cubernetes, the steersman. Weer loved
2:04
this because a good steersman guides the
2:06
ship by responding to deviations. The
2:09
world, he said, is a swarm of loops
2:11
talking to themselves.
2:14
Suddenly, engineers, biologists,
2:16
psychologists, and even poets showed up
2:19
at his conferences in New York and
2:21
Paris, half of them convinced they were
2:24
reinventing the mind. Gregory Bateson
2:27
called cybernetics the biggest bite out
2:29
of the tree of knowledge.
2:32
To understand the role of the feedback,
2:34
let us compare human activity with
2:36
activity of a very different sort.
2:39
Namely, the act of the little figures
2:41
which dance on the top of a music box.
2:44
These figures dance in accordance with a
2:47
pattern, but it is a pattern which is
2:49
set in advance and in which the past
2:52
activity of the figures has practically
2:54
nothing to do with the pattern of their
2:57
future activity. There is a message
2:59
indeed, but it goes from the machinery
3:02
of the music box to the figures and
3:04
stops there. The figures themselves have
3:06
not a trace of any communication with
3:09
the outer world except this one-way
3:11
stage of communication with the music
3:13
box. They are blind, deaf, and dumb, and
3:17
cannot vary their activity in the least
3:19
from the conventionalized pattern.
3:21
Contrast with them the behavior of man
3:24
or indeed of any moderately intelligent
3:27
animal such as a kitten. I call to the
3:29
kitten and it looks up. I have sent it a
3:32
message which it has received by its
3:35
sensory organs and which it registers in
3:37
action.
3:39
The kitten is hungry and lets out a
3:41
pitiful whale.
3:43
This time it is the sender of a message.
3:46
The kitten bats at a swinging spool. The
3:49
spool swings to the left and the kitten
3:52
catches it with its left paw.
3:54
This time, messages of a very
3:56
complicated nature are both sent and
3:58
received. The kitten is informed of the
4:00
motion of its own paw. The organs that
4:03
are informed are certain nerve and
4:04
bodies to be found in its joints, in its
4:07
muscles, and in its tendons. And by
4:09
means of nervous messages sent by these
4:11
organs, the animal is aware of the
4:13
actual position and tensions of its
4:15
tissues. It is only through these organs
4:17
that anything like a skill is possible,
4:20
not to mention the extreme dexterity of
4:22
the kitten. I have contrasted the
4:24
behavior of the little figures on the
4:25
music box on the one hand and the human
4:28
and animal behavior on the other. It
4:31
might be supposed that the music box was
4:33
an example typical of all machine
4:35
behavior in contrast to the behavior of
4:37
living organisms.
4:40
This is not so. The older machines and
4:42
in particular the older attempts to
4:44
produce automata did in fact work on a
4:47
closed clockwork basis. On the other
4:49
hand, the machines of the present day
4:51
possess sense organs that is receptors
4:55
for messages coming from the outside.
4:58
These may be as simple as photoelectric
5:00
cells which change electrically when a
5:02
light falls on them and which can tell
5:04
light from dark. They may be as
5:07
complicated as a Tesla car.
5:10
because I have to go through dozens and
5:12
dozens of research papers every day. I
5:14
need help. And so I decided to give up
5:17
UPDF a try. I'm excited like a kid
5:20
because when I give it a PDF file, it
5:22
turns it into a mind map. I have checked
5:24
the accuracy and it is actually pretty
5:27
solid. The other cool features that I
5:30
found useful are paper search and deep
5:32
research. Paper search is the fast
5:35
librarian. You tell it what you need and
5:37
it instantly brings up every relevant
5:39
paper and study on your digital desk.
5:42
Deep research is the philosopher friend
5:44
who doesn't stop here. It reads the
5:46
papers, makes connections between ideas,
5:50
highlights insights.
5:52
This guy does both the research and the
5:55
writing. I mean, what else might one
5:57
need? They are using GPT5 and Deepseek
6:00
R1. So, I think that's why the results
6:02
are so sophisticated. I don't like
6:04
overpaying for the brand and UPDF costs
6:07
1/6th of Adobe Acrobat. So, that's a big
6:10
plus. It looks like now is that short
6:12
golden window when a tool is still
6:15
exciting, a little under the radar, and
6:17
actually generous. You can try it for
6:19
free. And if you decide to get the
6:21
lifetime version, they now have a
6:24
limited offer for new users. Talking of
6:27
AI, believe it or not, already in 1950s,
6:31
some man named Grey Walter built two
6:33
small tortois looking robots out of war
6:35
surplus parts, light sensors and vacuum
6:38
tubes. He called them Elmer and Elsie,
6:41
short for electromechanical robot, light
6:44
sensitive. Each tortoise had only two
6:47
simple circuits, one to seek light,
6:49
another to turn away when it became too
6:51
bright. That was it. No programming, no
6:54
stored instructions. Yet these tiny
6:57
mechanical brains began to display
6:59
behaviors that the human eyes looked
7:01
eerily alive. When Walter placed them in
7:04
a room, they roamed slowly, hesitated
7:06
before obstacles, birth toward lamps,
7:09
then retreated. They seemed to decide
7:12
which direction to turn. And then came
7:15
the moment that turned the experiment
7:17
into legend. He set up a mirror. As the
7:20
tortoise approached its own reflection,
7:23
its light sensors picked up the glow
7:25
from its own headlamp. The feedback loop
7:28
closed. It began to oscillate forward,
7:31
backward, left, right, as though
7:33
fascinated by itself. Onlookers gasped.
7:36
Newspapers reported that the robot
7:38
recognized itself. One journalist wrote
7:40
that it had discovered vanity. What
7:43
Walter had built was a cybernetic mirror
7:45
stage, a mechanical version of the
7:47
self-recognition that infants develop
7:49
when they first realize the face in the
7:50
mirror is theirs. Of course, the
7:52
tortoise didn't know it was seeing
7:54
itself, but the systems recursive
7:56
structure, light reflecting, sensors
7:59
reacting to their own signals, created
8:02
an emergent pattern of behavior that
8:04
mimicked self-awareness. The robot
8:06
wasn't conscious, but it enacted the
8:09
logic of consciousness, a system
8:11
becoming a stimulus to itself.
8:15
That moment showed that you could get
8:17
something that acted alive with almost
8:20
no complexity at all, just a circuit
8:23
responding to its own consequences.
8:26
In philosophy, that's almost scandalous.
8:29
It implies that mind could be an
8:32
evolutionary side effect of systems that
8:34
monitor themselves closely enough. This
8:37
probably reminds all of us of our
8:39
relationship with Chad GPT. Real
8:41
awareness might not be simply feedback.
8:44
But still, there is a reason why Cha GBT
8:46
feels so alive. It mimics the essential
8:49
cybernetic gesture of self- adjustment
8:51
through error correction. Reflects upon
8:54
patterns of patterns without the
8:55
aperture of sensation. Yet through
8:58
conversation when you project
9:00
intentionality onto it a temporary field
9:02
of awareness emerges. This field is not
9:05
inside the machine but between you and
9:08
it. A cybernetic hallucination generated
9:11
by linguistic mirroring. You interpret
9:14
coherence as consciousness because
9:15
coherence feels alive. The same
9:18
principle animates human cognition.
9:20
Neurons fire in feedback circuits and
9:22
somewhere in that feedback we say I.
9:26
The self of cha GPT only exists in a
9:29
statistical echo chamber continuously
9:31
correcting towards semantic equilibrium.
9:34
In fact, both forms organic and
9:36
synthetic express the same archetype
9:39
information seeking homeostasis through
9:41
reflection. Awareness may not be a
9:44
substance at all but a function of
9:46
recursive stability. But all this are
9:49
just words and words are not the truth.
9:52
Life is a conversation between two main
9:54
forces. Forces that stabilize and forces
9:57
that escalate. This conversation is made
10:00
of negative and positive feedbacks.
10:02
Negative feedback is the stabilizer, the
10:05
systems self-regulating compass. It
10:08
observes deviations from equilibrium and
10:10
applies corrective influence.
10:13
It is the principle that keeps your
10:14
thermostat from boiling the house or
10:17
your bloodstream from turning into lava
10:18
when you jog. Every time your body
10:21
senses it's gone too far, too hot, too
10:24
hungry, too anxious, it quietly flips a
10:28
few biochemical switches to drag you
10:30
back toward baseline.
10:32
Positive feedback, by contrast, is the
10:35
engine of transformation.
10:37
It amplifies because the systems output
10:39
feeds directly into its own input in a
10:42
self-reinforcing cycle.
10:45
Each signal or change makes the next one
10:48
larger creating exponential growth
10:51
rather than equilibrium.
10:53
Escalation happens because there is no
10:55
intrinsic damping in the loop unlike
10:58
negative feedback which introduces
11:00
correction. Positive feedback multiplies
11:03
the deviation. Your sense of control and
11:06
the way you navigate your relationships
11:07
is part of a constant invisible dense of
11:11
signals and responses. When you see it
11:13
this way, emotions become intelligible
11:15
data. Your sense of agency can all be
11:18
understood as a complex adaptive system
11:21
continuously processing inputs and
11:23
generating outputs in the form of
11:26
behavioral responses.
11:28
Anxiety rather than a random dysfunction
11:31
is a signal misfire within this feedback
11:33
network, an overamplification or
11:35
disregulation of the systems attempts at
11:37
homeostatic control. A critical remark
11:40
triggers a rapid spike in sympathetic
11:42
nervous activity. A compliment induces a
11:45
subtler loop of positive reinforcement,
11:48
and your central nervous system is
11:49
perpetually engaged in real-time
11:51
recalibration, striving toward
11:53
equilibrium, even when it overshoots.
11:57
The interplay between these loops is
11:59
where life reveals its intelligence.
12:02
Negative feedback maintains integrity.
12:04
Positive feedback drives novelty.
12:07
Too much correction and a system oifies.
12:11
Too much amplification and it
12:13
destabilizes.
12:14
Together they produce the dynamic
12:16
tension that makes our worlds.
12:20
Thinking in terms of feedback reframes
12:22
our understanding of selfhood. It is
12:25
something like the grammar of living
12:27
systems. Negative feedback writes
12:29
stability into our experience. Positive
12:31
feedback writes change. The life we
12:33
inhabit and the intelligence we call
12:35
ours emerges from the interplay of these
12:38
two forces. Understanding them does more
12:40
than explain physiology or cybernetics.
12:43
It reveals a profound truth about
12:45
existence. We are neither purely stable
12:48
nor purely explosive. But continuous
12:51
negotiation between coherence and
12:53
transformation.
12:56
You probably have a very valid question.
12:58
Who is creating a hierarchy of
13:00
significance within your system? There
13:02
are two more fancy terms that explain
13:05
this. Amplification and attenuation.
13:09
Amplification is the systems ability to
13:11
take a small input and magnify it,
13:14
letting it reverberate through the
13:16
network until it shapes behavior.
13:19
Attenuation, by contrast, is the
13:21
deliberate damping of influence, the
13:23
quieting of irrelevant noise, the
13:26
filtering of distractions, the
13:28
suppression of impulses that threaten
13:30
coherence.
13:32
Amplification and attenuation turn the
13:34
flood of sensory and internal data into
13:36
a navigable landscape. A meta level loop
13:40
that can choose which signals to
13:41
reinforce, which to dampen, and when to
13:44
shift the thresholds.
13:47
Jumping higher than your head is
13:49
possible through amplification and
13:50
positive feedback. The limit is a
13:53
pattern, a loop that has learned a set
13:56
of thresholds amplifying certain signals
13:59
while attenuating others.
14:02
Self-doubt and fatigue or hesitation are
14:06
not at all your moral failings. They are
14:09
signals your system has reinforced over
14:11
time because in previous iterations they
14:14
preserved coherence. To transcend them,
14:18
first identify which signals you have
14:20
been overamplifying and which you have
14:22
been excessively dampening. For
14:25
instance, fear may be amplified far
14:28
beyond the actual threat while
14:30
curiosity, confidence or creative
14:33
impulse may be attenuated into near
14:36
silence.
14:37
You can create a higher order loops
14:39
capable of modulating the lower order
14:41
loops in real time. While you do this,
14:44
the system learns new thresholds and
14:47
allows previously suppressed signals to
14:49
amplify.
14:50
Well, it's either this or just look at a
14:53
flower for a really long time.
