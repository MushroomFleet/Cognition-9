# Building Orchestrator → Sub-Agent Systems with Claude Code: Comprehensive Implementation Guide

## Executive summary

This research synthesizes production patterns, cybernetic principles, and practical implementation guidance for building sophisticated multi-agent orchestration systems using Claude Code with markdown-based agent specifications. **The core finding**: Claude Code's native custom agent capabilities (v1.0.60+), combined with YAML-based configurations and cybernetic feedback patterns, enable production-ready systems that outperform single agents by 90%+ on parallelizable tasks—but at 15× token cost requiring careful architectural decisions. Context engineering dominates development effort; multi-agent systems excel at reading/research tasks but single agents often work better for writing/synthesis. The research identifies proven patterns from systems processing 10M+ executions monthly, with detailed specifications for dynamic system prompts, .md format agent logic, feedback loops, and emergent coordination mechanisms.

## Claude Code native multi-agent architecture

### Custom agents: The foundation

Claude Code introduced **Custom Agents** in v1.0.60 as the recommended approach for multi-agent orchestration. Each agent operates with isolated 200k token context windows, preventing "context poisoning" where different tasks interfere. Agents automatically activate based on task description matching—similar to tool invocation, Claude intelligently routes work to appropriate specialists.

### Performance characteristics from production

Anthropic's internal research reveals **critical metrics**: Multi-agent with Opus 4 lead + Sonnet 4 sub-agents **outperformed single-agent Opus 4 by 90.2%** on research tasks. Token usage explains **80% of performance variance**. Multi-agent systems use **~15× more tokens** than chat interactions. Complex features reduced from 45 minutes to under 10 minutes. Supports up to **10 parallel tasks** concurrently. **The cost-benefit equation**: 15× token overhead only justified for high-value, parallelizable tasks where speed and quality gains exceed costs.

### Three orchestration patterns

**Pattern 1: Parallel execution** (independent tasks):
```
Orchestrator
  ├── Task(backend-specialist, "Build API endpoint")
  ├── Task(frontend-specialist, "Build UI component")  
  ├── Task(qa-specialist, "Write test suite")
  └── Task(docs-specialist, "Update documentation")
```

**Pattern 2: Sequential handoffs** (assembly line):
```
product-manager → ux-designer → senior-engineer → code-reviewer
```

**Pattern 3: Hub-and-spoke** (central orchestrator):
```
                Lead Researcher
                      ↓
        ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
        ↓             ↓             ↓
   Subagent 1    Subagent 2    Subagent 3
```

## Markdown-based agent specifications

### AGENTS.md standard format

AGENTS.md is an emerging open standard adopted by **20,000+ GitHub repositories**, designed as "README for machines." It provides universal, ecosystem-agnostic guidance for AI coding agents.

**Standard structure**:
```markdown
# AGENTS.md

## Setup commands
- Install: `pnpm install`
- Dev server: `pnpm dev`
- Tests: `pnpm test`

## Code style
- TypeScript strict mode
- Single quotes, no semicolons
- Functional patterns preferred

## Testing instructions
- Run `pnpm turbo run test --filter <project>`
- Fix all test/type errors before committing

## Agent coordination
- Researcher agent: Gathers requirements
- Implementation agent: Writes code
- QA agent: Validates and tests
- Handoff: Each agent writes to dedicated .md file
```

## Cybernetic principles for agent orchestration

### Viable System Model (VSM): The architectural blueprint

The VSM provides a proven framework for organizing complex systems. Applied to multi-agent orchestration:

**System 5 (Policy)**: Policy agent defining permissible actions, ethical boundaries
**System 4 (Intelligence)**: Strategic planning agent analyzing context, decomposing tasks
**System 3 (Control)**: Control/supervisor agent managing workers, enforcing quality gates
**System 2 (Coordination)**: Coordinator agent resolving conflicts, preventing duplicate work
**System 1 (Operations)**: Specialized worker agents executing specific tasks

**Key cybernetic principles**:
1. **Requisite Variety (Ashby's Law)**: Controller variety must match system variety
2. **Recursiveness**: Each subsystem is itself a viable system
3. **Algedonic Alerts**: Rapid escalation of critical deviations

### Feedback loops: Self-correction and amplification

**Negative feedback (error correction)** - The Self-Refine pattern achieves 5-40% improvement over direct generation:

```python
def self_refine_loop(task, agent, max_iterations=5):
    output = agent.generate(task)
    history = [output]
    
    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        feedback = agent.critique(output, task.quality_criteria, history)
        if feedback.quality_score >= task.threshold:
            break
        output = agent.refine(output, feedback, history, task)
        history.append(output)
    
    return output
```

**Critical insight**: **LLMs cannot reliably self-correct alone—external tools are essential**. The **CRITIC pattern** uses tool-based validation (code interpreters, tests, validators).

**Positive feedback (amplification)** - Skill Library pattern achieved 93% improvement:

```python
class SkillLibrary:
    def store(self, task, solution, success_metrics):
        if success_metrics.quality >= 0.9:
            self.skills.append({
                "task_pattern": self.extract_pattern(task),
                "solution_template": solution,
                "success_rate": success_metrics.quality
            })
    
    def retrieve(self, new_task):
        return [s for s in self.skills 
                if self.similarity(s.task_pattern, new_task) > 0.7]
```

### Emergent behaviors: Design and measurement

**Breakthrough finding**: **Productive emergence requires BOTH redundancy AND synergy**
- **Redundancy** = Goal alignment (shared objectives)
- **Synergy** = Complementary specialization (unique contributions)

**Design recipe**:
```yaml
researcher_1:
  role: "Academic Research Specialist"
  personality:
    occupation: "Professor"
    traits: {openness: 0.9, conscientiousness: 0.8}
    values: ["accuracy", "thoroughness"]
  theory_of_mind: true  # Key enabler
  
shared_goal: "Provide comprehensive research on {topic}"
```

**Theory of Mind prompting** (critical for productive emergence):
```markdown
## Team Context
You are working with:
- {{peer.name}} ({{peer.occupation}}) - Focus: {{peer.specialty}}

Consider:
1. What might others miss given their backgrounds?
2. How can your perspective complement theirs?
3. What gaps would exist if you didn't contribute?
```

**Results**: Persona + Theory of Mind agents show 18% emergence rate with goal-directed, productive coordination.

## Emergent pipeline brainstorm: Novel cybernetic architectures

### Architecture 1: Adaptive resonance orchestrator

**Concept**: Self-organizing agent network that dynamically adjusts specialization based on task patterns, inspired by Adaptive Resonance Theory.

**Components**:
- **Pattern Recognition Layer**: Identifies task types and complexity
- **Agent Pool**: Generalist agents that specialize on-demand
- **Resonance Detector**: Measures alignment between task and agent capability
- **Adaptation Engine**: Tunes agent prompts based on performance feedback

**Novel Features**:
1. **Dynamic Specialization**: Agents develop expertise through experience
2. **Vigilance Parameter**: Controls when new specialist emerges vs using existing
3. **Plasticity-Stability Balance**: Learn new patterns while preserving successful ones

**Implementation sketch**:
```python
class AdaptiveResonanceOrchestrator:
    def match_or_create_specialist(self, task):
        # Calculate resonance with existing specialists
        resonances = [
            (agent, self.calculate_resonance(agent, task))
            for agent in self.specialists
        ]
        
        best_match, resonance = max(resonances, key=lambda x: x[1])
        
        if resonance > self.vigilance_threshold:
            # Good match - use existing specialist
            return best_match.adapt_to(task)
        else:
            # Poor match - create new specialist
            new_specialist = self.spawn_specialist(task)
            self.specialists.append(new_specialist)
            return new_specialist
```

**Cybernetic principles applied**:
- Positive feedback: Successful patterns reinforced
- Negative feedback: Poor performance triggers adaptation
- Homeostasis: Vigilance parameter maintains stable number of specialists
- Emergence: Specialization emerges from experience

### Architecture 2: Stigmergic coordination

**Concept**: Agents coordinate through shared environment modification (like ant pheromones), not direct communication. Inspired by swarm intelligence.

**Components**:
- **Shared Context Board**: Persistent artifact store agents can read/write
- **Signal Strength Decay**: Information fades over time unless reinforced
- **Amplification Rules**: Successful patterns get stronger signals
- **Attenuation Rules**: Conflicting signals cancel out

**Novel Features**:
1. **Implicit Coordination**: No central orchestrator needed
2. **Emergent Priorities**: Important tasks attract multiple agents
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Competing approaches naturally compete
4. **Self-Organization**: Work distribution emerges from local rules

**Implementation sketch**:
```python
class StigmergicBoard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.signals = {}  # task_id -> {signal_strength, approach, timestamp}
    
    def deposit_signal(self, task_id, approach, success_metric):
        # Stronger signal for successful approaches
        strength = success_metric * 10
        
        if task_id in self.signals:
            if self.signals[task_id]['approach'] == approach:
                # Reinforce same approach (positive feedback)
                self.signals[task_id]['signal_strength'] += strength
            else:
                # Competing approach (negative feedback)
                self.signals[task_id]['signal_strength'] -= strength
        else:
            self.signals[task_id] = {
                'signal_strength': strength,
                'approach': approach,
                'timestamp': time.time()
            }
    
    def decay_signals(self):
        # Information fades over time
        for task_id in self.signals:
            age = time.time() - self.signals[task_id]['timestamp']
            self.signals[task_id]['signal_strength'] *= exp(-age / decay_rate)
    
    def strongest_signal(self, task_id):
        return self.signals.get(task_id, {}).get('approach')

class StigmergicAgent:
    def work_cycle(self):
        while True:
            # Read signals from environment
            tasks = self.board.get_all_signals()
            
            # Choose task based on signal strength + capability match
            task = self.select_task(tasks)
            
            # Execute approach suggested by strongest signal
            approach = self.board.strongest_signal(task.id)
            result = self.execute(task, approach)
            
            # Deposit signal based on success
            self.board.deposit_signal(task.id, approach, result.quality)
```

**Cybernetic principles applied**:
- Self-organization through local rules
- Positive feedback amplifies successful approaches
- Negative feedback attenuates conflicting signals
- Homeostasis via signal decay prevents runaway

### Architecture 3: Predictive processing hierarchy

**Concept**: Hierarchical agents that predict lower-level outputs and only intervene when predictions fail (prediction error minimization), inspired by neuroscience.

**Components**:
- **Prediction Layers**: Each level predicts next level's output
- **Error Detectors**: Measure prediction vs reality
- **Precision Weighting**: High-precision errors trigger intervention
- **Update Propagation**: Errors flow upward, corrections downward

**Novel Features**:
1. **Minimal Intervention**: Higher levels only engage when needed
2. **Efficient Resource Use**: Most work at lowest competent level
3. **Continuous Learning**: Predictions improve over time
4. **Graceful Degradation**: System works even with component failures

**Implementation sketch**:
```python
class PredictiveLayer:
    def __init__(self, level):
        self.level = level
        self.predictor = self.build_predictor()
        self.precision = 0.8  # Confidence in predictions
    
    def process(self, input_data):
        # Predict what lower level should produce
        prediction = self.predictor.predict(input_data)
        
        # Get actual output from lower level
        actual = self.lower_level.process(input_data)
        
        # Calculate prediction error
        error = self.compute_error(prediction, actual)
        
        # Only intervene if error exceeds threshold (weighted by precision)
        if error * self.precision > self.intervention_threshold:
            # Prediction failed - take direct action
            corrected = self.intervene(input_data, actual, error)
            
            # Update predictor
            self.predictor.learn(input_data, corrected)
            
            return corrected
        else:
            # Prediction accurate - trust lower level
            return actual

class PredictiveHierarchy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.layers = [
            PredictiveLayer(0),  # Operational
            PredictiveLayer(1),  # Tactical
            PredictiveLayer(2),  # Strategic
            PredictiveLayer(3)   # Policy
        ]
        
        # Connect layers
        for i in range(len(self.layers) - 1):
            self.layers[i+1].lower_level = self.layers[i]
```

**Cybernetic principles applied**:
- Hierarchical control with minimal intervention
- Error signals as communication channel
- Precision weighting implements attenuation/amplification
- Learning through prediction error minimization

### Architecture 4: Homeostatic multi-objective optimizer

**Concept**: System maintains multiple competing objectives in dynamic equilibrium, like biological homeostasis maintaining pH, temperature, etc.

**Components**:
- **Objective Monitors**: Track multiple quality dimensions
- **Setpoint Manager**: Defines target ranges for each objective
- **Trade-off Resolver**: Balances competing objectives
- **Intervention Scheduler**: Decides which objective needs attention

**Novel Features**:
1. **Multi-Objective Balance**: Maintains quality, speed, cost, novelty simultaneously
2. **Dynamic Setpoints**: Targets adjust based on context
3. **Graceful Trade-offs**: Explicitly manages quality vs speed vs cost
4. **Failure Prevention**: Intervenes before critical thresholds

**Implementation sketch**:
```python
class HomeostaticObjective:
    def __init__(self, name, setpoint, tolerance, priority):
        self.name = name
        self.setpoint = setpoint
        self.tolerance = tolerance
        self.priority = priority
        self.history = []
    
    def deviation(self, current_value):
        return abs(self.setpoint - current_value)
    
    def urgency(self, current_value):
        # Urgency increases with deviation and priority
        dev = self.deviation(current_value)
        if dev < self.tolerance:
            return 0
        return (dev / self.tolerance) * self.priority

class HomeostaticOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.objectives = {
            'quality': HomeostaticObjective('quality', 0.9, 0.05, priority=10),
            'speed': HomeostaticObjective('speed', 2.0, 0.5, priority=7),
            'cost': HomeostaticObjective('cost', 100, 20, priority=8),
            'novelty': HomeostaticObjective('novelty', 0.7, 0.1, priority=5)
        }
    
    def execute(self, task):
        result = self.primary_agent.execute(task)
        
        # Measure all objectives
        measurements = {
            'quality': self.evaluate_quality(result),
            'speed': self.measure_speed(result),
            'cost': self.calculate_cost(result),
            'novelty': self.assess_novelty(result)
        }
        
        # Calculate urgency for each objective
        urgencies = {
            name: obj.urgency(measurements[name])
            for name, obj in self.objectives.items()
        }
        
        # Intervene on most urgent objective
        most_urgent = max(urgencies, key=urgencies.get)
        
        if urgencies[most_urgent] > 0:
            # Apply corrective action
            result = self.correct_for_objective(
                result, 
                most_urgent, 
                self.objectives[most_urgent]
            )
        
        return result
    
    def correct_for_objective(self, result, objective_name, objective):
        if objective_name == 'quality':
            # Increase refinement iterations
            return self.refine_until_threshold(result, objective.setpoint)
        elif objective_name == 'speed':
            # Reduce complexity or use faster agents
            return self.optimize_for_speed(result)
        elif objective_name == 'cost':
            # Use cheaper models or reduce iterations
            return self.optimize_for_cost(result)
        elif objective_name == 'novelty':
            # Inject creative variation
            return self.enhance_novelty(result)
```

### Architecture 5: Recursive meta-learning orchestrator

**Concept**: System that learns how to orchestrate itself better through recursive self-improvement, creating meta-agents that optimize agent coordination.

**Components**:
- **Execution Layer**: Agents performing actual tasks
- **Meta Layer**: Agents optimizing coordination strategies
- **Meta-Meta Layer**: Agents improving the meta-learning process
- **Performance Memory**: Database of what orchestration strategies worked

**Novel Features**:
1. **Self-Improving Orchestration**: System learns better coordination over time
2. **Strategy Library**: Successful orchestration patterns stored and reused
3. **A/B Testing**: Different coordination approaches evaluated
4. **Recursive Depth Control**: Prevents infinite meta-regression

**Implementation sketch**:
```python
class RecursiveMetaOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, max_meta_depth=3):
        self.execution_agents = self.create_workers()
        self.meta_agent = self.create_meta_learner()
        self.strategy_library = StrategyLibrary()
        self.max_meta_depth = max_meta_depth
    
    def execute(self, task, meta_depth=0):
        if meta_depth >= self.max_meta_depth:
            # Base case: just execute
            return self.simple_execution(task)
        
        # Meta-level: optimize coordination strategy
        historical_data = self.strategy_library.get_similar(task)
        
        if historical_data:
            # Use learned strategy
            strategy = historical_data.best_strategy
        else:
            # Meta-learn new strategy
            strategy = self.meta_agent.generate_strategy(
                task,
                self.execution_agents,
                meta_depth + 1  # Recursive call
            )
        
        # Execute with optimized strategy
        result = self.execute_with_strategy(task, strategy)
        
        # Store results for future learning
        self.strategy_library.store(
            task_pattern=self.extract_pattern(task),
            strategy=strategy,
            performance=self.evaluate(result)
        )
        
        # Meta-meta level: improve the meta-learning itself
        if meta_depth == 0:
            self.improve_meta_learning()
        
        return result
    
    def execute_with_strategy(self, task, strategy):
        # Strategy specifies: which agents, in what order, with what coordination
        if strategy.pattern == 'parallel':
            return self.parallel_execution(task, strategy)
        elif strategy.pattern == 'sequential':
            return self.sequential_execution(task, strategy)
        elif strategy.pattern == 'hierarchical':
            return self.hierarchical_execution(task, strategy)
    
    def improve_meta_learning(self):
        # Analyze what meta-strategies worked best
        meta_performance = self.strategy_library.analyze_meta_patterns()
        
        # Update meta-agent's approach
        self.meta_agent.update_from_analysis(meta_performance)
```

**Cybernetic principles applied**:
- Recursive control loops at multiple levels
- Positive feedback amplifies successful meta-strategies
- Learning accumulates in strategy library
- Bounded recursion prevents infinite regress

### Integration: Hybrid cybernetic architecture

**Combining all five approaches**:

```python
class HybridCyberneticOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        # Architecture 1: Adaptive specialists
        self.adaptive_resonance = AdaptiveResonanceOrchestrator()
        
        # Architecture 2: Stigmergic coordination
        self.stigmergic_board = StigmergicBoard()
        
        # Architecture 3: Predictive hierarchy
        self.predictive_hierarchy = PredictiveHierarchy()
        
        # Architecture 4: Homeostatic balancing
        self.homeostatic_manager = HomeostaticOrchestrator()
        
        # Architecture 5: Meta-learning
        self.meta_learner = RecursiveMetaOrchestrator()
    
    def execute(self, task):
        # Meta-learner selects overall strategy
        strategy = self.meta_learner.generate_strategy(task)
        
        # Adaptive resonance finds/creates specialists
        specialists = [
            self.adaptive_resonance.match_or_create_specialist(subtask)
            for subtask in strategy.subtasks
        ]
        
        # Stigmergic coordination for implicit cooperation
        for specialist in specialists:
            specialist.set_coordination_board(self.stigmergic_board)
        
        # Predictive hierarchy for efficient oversight
        result = self.predictive_hierarchy.process_with_specialists(
            specialists, 
            strategy
        )
        
        # Homeostatic balancing across objectives
        balanced_result = self.homeostatic_manager.balance_objectives(result)
        
        return balanced_result
```

**Key innovations**:
1. **Self-organizing specialization** emerges from task patterns
2. **Implicit coordination** reduces communication overhead
3. **Minimal intervention** from higher levels increases efficiency
4. **Multi-objective balance** maintains quality across dimensions
5. **Continuous improvement** through meta-learning

**Practical applications**:
- **Research systems**: Specialists emerge for different domains, stigmergic signals indicate promising directions
- **Software development**: Predictive hierarchy intervenes only when quality drops, homeostasis balances speed vs quality
- **Content generation**: Adaptive agents specialize in different styles, meta-learning optimizes content strategy
- **Complex analysis**: Self-organizing investigation paths, multiple objectives balanced automatically

## Key takeaways and recommendations

### When to use multi-agent orchestration

**✅ Ideal scenarios**:
- **Parallelizable research/analysis**: Multiple independent information streams
- **Specialized expertise needed**: Different tools, domains, or approaches required
- **High-value complex tasks**: Quality gains justify 15× token cost
- **Context exceeds single window**: Need to process more information than fits in one context

**❌ Avoid when**:
- **Shared context required**: Agents need constant synchronization
- **Primarily writing tasks**: Code generation, content synthesis (single agent better)
- **Low-value routine tasks**: Cost overhead not justified
- **Early development**: Start simple, add complexity only when proven necessary

### Critical success factors

**Context engineering is #1 priority** (consensus from Anthropic and Cognition):
- Extremely detailed task descriptions prevent duplicate work
- Clear boundaries between agent responsibilities
- Explicit output formats and quality criteria
- Tool guidance and source prioritization

**Production infrastructure essential**:
- Durable execution with checkpointing
- Comprehensive observability from day 1
- Evaluation datasets and continuous testing
- Cost monitoring and circuit breakers

**Start simple, evolve systematically**:
- Begin with supervisor pattern (1 orchestrator + 2-3 workers)
- Add feedback loops early (Self-Refine + CRITIC)
- Implement observability before complexity
- Let real needs drive architecture decisions

### Framework selection guidance

**Choose LangGraph when**:
- Need maximum control and customization
- Complex state management required
- Production reliability critical
- Team comfortable with lower-level programming

**Choose CrewAI when**:
- Rapid development prioritized
- Role-based agent teams natural fit
- Straightforward sequential/hierarchical workflows
- Team wants higher-level abstractions

**Choose Semantic Kernel when**:
- Enterprise .NET/Azure environment
- Multi-language support needed (C#, Python, Java)
- Microsoft ecosystem integration important
- A2A protocol and MCP support required

**Choose Langroid when**:
- Fast time-to-production critical
- Clean, Pythonic API preferred
- Message-passing model intuitive for team
- Simpler architecture sufficient

### Cybernetic design principles

**Apply Requisite Variety (Ashby's Law)**:
- Orchestrator must match system complexity
- Attenuate information flowing upward (summaries, metrics)
- Amplify directives flowing downward (detailed instructions)

**Implement Viable System Model**:
- Ensure all 5 systems present (Policy, Intelligence, Control, Coordination, Operations)
- Each subsystem can itself be a viable system (recursive structure)
- Rapid escalation for critical deviations (algedonic alerts)

**Design for emergence**:
- Assign stable personas for identity-linked differentiation
- Enable Theory of Mind prompting for productive coordination
- Measure synergy AND redundancy with information-theoretic metrics
- Shared goals + complementary specialization = productive emergence

**Maintain homeostasis**:
- Define clear setpoints for critical metrics
- Implement negative feedback loops for stability
- Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
- Balance multiple competing objectives dynamically

### Cost management strategies

**15× token overhead requires**:
- High-value task selection (justify the cost)
- Complexity analysis before dispatch (avoid unnecessary multi-agent)
- Early termination when quality threshold met
- Token budgets and monitoring
- Intelligent caching of results

**Optimization techniques**:
- Dynamic agent spawning based on need
- Shared context caching between related tasks
- Parallel execution only when truly independent
- Cheaper models for routine subtasks (Sonnet for workers, Opus for synthesis)

## Conclusion

Building production-ready orchestrator → sub-agent systems with Claude Code requires balancing sophisticated architectural patterns with practical implementation concerns. The research reveals that Claude Code's native custom agent capabilities, combined with YAML-based configurations and cybernetic control principles, provide a solid foundation for systems that significantly outperform single agents on appropriate tasks.

**The critical insight**: Multi-agent orchestration is not a universal solution but a powerful tool for specific scenarios—primarily parallelizable research and analysis tasks where context exceeds single windows and quality gains justify substantial token costs. Context engineering dominates development effort and determines success more than architectural complexity.

**Three implementation paths forward**:

1. **Pragmatic production path**: Start with Claude Code custom agents + supervisor pattern + feedback loops. This provides 80% of the value with 20% of the complexity. Add VSM hierarchy and emergence patterns only when justified by real needs.

2. **Research-optimized path**: Implement full VSM hierarchy with stigmergic coordination and emergence detection for systems handling hundreds of research queries daily. Appropriate for high-value research automation where quality and comprehensiveness are paramount.

3. **Experimental innovation path**: Explore novel cybernetic architectures (adaptive resonance, predictive processing, recursive meta-learning) for pushing boundaries of what multi-agent systems can achieve. Suitable for R&D contexts with tolerance for experimentation.

**Most teams should start with path 1**, adding sophistication incrementally as concrete needs emerge. The frameworks and patterns documented here provide a roadmap from simple supervisor orchestration to advanced cybernetic architectures, with production examples demonstrating that both approaches can operate at massive scale (10M+ executions monthly).

The future of multi-agent orchestration lies in systems that self-organize, learn from experience, coordinate implicitly, and maintain homeostasis across competing objectives—all while remaining explainable and controllable. The cybernetic principles outlined here provide the theoretical foundation, while the practical patterns from Claude Code, CrewAI, LangGraph, and other frameworks offer proven implementation paths.

Start simple. Measure everything. Let real needs drive complexity. Build the simplest system that could possibly work, then evolve it systematically based on evidence from production use.
