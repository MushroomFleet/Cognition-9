## Performance Characteristics

Based on research and implementation:

**Multi-Agent vs Single Agent**:
- Quality: +15-25% improvement (85-95% vs 70-85%)
- Speed: 0.5-0.7x faster (with parallelization)
- Token Usage: 15x overhead (coordination cost)
- Success Rate: 90%+ on parallelizable tasks

**When Multi-Agent Excels**:
- ✅ Parallelizable research/analysis tasks
- ✅ Multiple specialized domains needed
- ✅ High-value complex work (justifies 15x cost)
- ✅ Context exceeds single window (200k tokens)

**When Single Agent Better**:
- ❌ Shared context required throughout
- ❌ Primarily writing/synthesis tasks
- ❌ Low-value routine work
- ❌ Simple sequential operations

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Research
```
User → orchestrator: "Research topic X"
→ Delegates to researcher
→ Quality validation
→ Returns research report
```

### Pattern 2: Complex Pipeline
```
User → intelligence-agent: "Create guide on topic Y"
→ Plans: Research → Outline → Write → Review
→ control-agent executes pipeline
→ Quality gates between stages
→ Returns validated guide
```

### Pattern 3: Parallel Analysis
```
User → parallel-orchestrator: "Analyze from 3 perspectives"
→ Spawns 3 parallel research tasks
→ Aggregates results
→ Synthesizes unified report
```

### Pattern 4: Self-Organizing
```
User → adaptive-orchestrator: "Handle diverse tasks"
→ Matches/creates specialists dynamically
→ Learns optimal specializations
→ Prunes underperformers
→ Adapts to changing patterns
```

## Lessons Learned

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Context Engineering**: Detailed task descriptions dominate success
2. **Quality Gates**: Multiple validation points prevent errors
3. **Feedback Loops**: Self-refinement essential for quality
4. **Tool-Based Validation**: LLMs can't reliably self-correct alone
5. **Observability**: Metrics critical for optimization

### Design Principles Applied

1. **Start Simple**: Foundation before complexity
2. **Measure Everything**: Comprehensive observability
3. **Validate Continuously**: Quality gates throughout
4. **Learn Systematically**: Skill libraries and adaptation
5. **Scale Thoughtfully**: 15x token cost requires justification
