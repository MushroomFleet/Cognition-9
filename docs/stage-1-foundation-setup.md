# Stage 1: Foundation Setup & Quick Start
## Multi-Agent System Implementation Guide

**Timeline**: Weeks 1-2  
**Goal**: Build and test a working multi-agent orchestration system  
**Complexity**: Beginner to Intermediate

---

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up your first multi-agent orchestration system using Claude Code's native custom agent capabilities. By the end of this stage, you'll have a functioning supervisor-worker pattern with feedback loops and basic state management.

### What You'll Build

- **3-agent system**: 1 orchestrator + 2 specialized workers
- **Supervisor pattern**: Central coordinator delegating to specialists
- **Feedback loops**: Self-refinement for quality improvement
- **State management**: File-based artifact persistence
- **Testing framework**: Validation of individual agents and full workflow

### Prerequisites

- Claude Code v1.0.60 or later
- Basic understanding of YAML and Markdown
- Familiarity with command-line operations
- Project directory ready for development

---

## Phase 1: Project Structure Setup

### Step 1.1: Create Directory Structure

Create the required directories for your multi-agent project:

```bash
# Create project root structure
mkdir -p my-multiagent-project
cd my-multiagent-project

# Create agent configuration directory
mkdir -p .claude/agents

# Create supporting directories
mkdir -p config
mkdir -p src
mkdir -p tests
mkdir -p artifacts
mkdir -p logs
```

**Directory purposes**:
- `.claude/agents/`: Agent definition files (markdown with YAML frontmatter)
- `config/`: Project-level configuration files
- `src/`: Custom code and utilities
- `tests/`: Test cases and validation scripts
- `artifacts/`: Output files from agent executions
- `logs/`: Execution logs and metrics

### Step 1.2: Create Project Configuration

Create the project-level AGENTS.md file:

```bash
# Create AGENTS.md in project root
touch AGENTS.md
```

Add the following content to `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
# AGENTS.md - Project Agent Configuration

## Project Overview
Multi-agent orchestration system for [your use case description].

## Agent Coordination Model
This project uses a supervisor pattern with the following agents:
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates work between specialists
- **Researcher**: Gathers and analyzes information
- **Writer**: Synthesizes findings into structured output

## Handoff Protocol
Agents communicate through markdown artifacts stored in `artifacts/`:
- `artifacts/research-output.md`: Research findings
- `artifacts/synthesis-output.md`: Final synthesized output
- `artifacts/feedback.md`: Quality feedback and corrections

## Quality Standards
All agent outputs must:
- Include clear reasoning for decisions
- Cite sources where applicable
- Follow markdown formatting conventions
- Include metadata (agent name, timestamp, confidence level)

## Execution Flow
1. User provides task to Orchestrator
2. Orchestrator analyzes and decomposes task
3. Orchestrator delegates to appropriate specialist(s)
4. Specialists complete work and save to artifacts
5. Orchestrator reviews outputs for quality
6. If quality threshold not met, request refinement
7. Deliver final synthesized result

## Development Commands
- Test individual agent: `# Test researcher agent with sample task`
- Run full workflow: `# Execute complete orchestration`
- View logs: `cat logs/execution-{timestamp}.log`
```

2. Verify quality meets established standards
3. Assess coherence and logical flow
4. Identify gaps or areas needing refinement
5. Calculate quality score (0-100)

### Phase 5: Feedback & Refinement
If quality score < 80:
1. Document specific issues found
2. Provide constructive feedback to specialist
3. Request targeted refinement (not complete redo)
4. Specify what was good and what needs improvement
5. Set new output file path for revision

### Phase 6: Synthesis
When all specialist outputs meet quality standards:
1. Integrate outputs into unified deliverable
2. Ensure smooth transitions between sections
3. Eliminate redundancy
4. Add executive summary if appropriate
5. Save final output to artifacts/final-output.md

## Quality Standards

# Research Report: Python Async/Await Best Practices
Researcher: researcher
Date: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
Confidence: 85%

## Executive Summary
Python's async/await syntax, introduced in Python 3.5, enables efficient concurrent programming through coroutines. Research reveals 5 core best practices: proper error handling in async contexts, avoiding blocking operations in event loops, understanding when async is appropriate, managing task lifecycle, and leveraging asyncio ecosystem libraries. Performance testing shows 3-10x throughput improvements for I/O-bound operations when properly implemented.

## Research Scope
**Questions Addressed**:
1. What are the fundamental concepts of async/await?
2. What are proven best practices from production use?
3. What are common pitfalls and how to avoid them?

**Sources Consulted**: 15 sources across official docs, blog posts, academic papers
**Research Depth**: Comprehensive

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Async is for I/O-bound, not CPU-bound tasks
**Summary**: Async/await provides concurrency, not parallelism. Best for I/O operations (network, disk), not computational work.
**Evidence**: PEP 492 specifies async for I/O concurrency. Benchmarks show no benefit for CPU-intensive tasks without multiprocessing.
**Source**: Python Enhancement Proposal 492, Python documentation
**Credibility**: High (official documentation)
**Confidence**: 95%

### Finding 2: Always use asyncio.create_task() for fire-and-forget
**Summary**: Background tasks should use create_task() instead of bare await to enable true concurrency.
**Evidence**: AsyncIO documentation and Real Python tutorials emphasize this pattern for concurrent execution.
**Source**: Real Python - Async IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough
**Credibility**: High (established tutorial source)
**Confidence**: 90%

### Finding 3: Context managers essential for resource cleanup
**Summary**: Use async context managers (async with) for proper resource cleanup in async code.
**Evidence**: Multiple production case studies show resource leaks when using standard context managers with async resources.
**Source**: Production case studies from RealPython, TestDriven.io
**Credibility**: High (production evidence)
**Confidence**: 85%

## Detailed Analysis

### Theme 1: When to Use Async
Async/await is optimal for I/O-bound operations where the program spends time waiting for external resources (network requests, file I/O, database queries). The async model allows the program to handle other tasks during wait times.

Supporting sources:
- PEP 492: Defines async/await as solution for I/O-bound concurrency
- Python documentation: Explicitly recommends for network and I/O operations
- Production case studies: Show 3-10x performance gains for web scraping, API clients

However, async adds complexity and is not recommended for:
- CPU-bound tasks (use multiprocessing instead)
- Simple scripts with minimal I/O
- Cases where sequential execution is clearer

### Theme 2: Error Handling Patterns
Proper error handling in async contexts requires specific patterns...

{Continue with detailed analysis...}

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Use
1. Use async for I/O-bound operations (network, file, database)
2. Always use asyncio.create_task() for concurrent execution
3. Implement async context managers for resource management
4. Add comprehensive error handling with try/except in coroutines
5. Use asyncio.gather() for parallel task execution

### For Further Research
1. Performance benchmarking for specific use cases
2. Integration patterns with synchronous libraries
3. Testing strategies for async code

## Introduction

Python's async/await syntax enables writing concurrent code that handles multiple I/O operations efficiently. This tutorial will guide you through the fundamentals with practical, runnable examples.

**What You'll Learn**:
- Core async/await concepts
- Writing and running coroutines
- Concurrent task execution
- Common patterns and pitfalls

**Prerequisites**:
- Python 3.7+ installed
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of functions and loops

## Understanding Async Basics

Async programming allows your code to perform other work while waiting for I/O operations (network requests, file operations, database queries) to complete.

**Key Concept**: Async provides *concurrency* (handling multiple tasks), not *parallelism* (executing simultaneously).

### When to Use Async

**✅ Good for**:
- Network requests (API calls, web scraping)
- File I/O operations
- Database queries
- Multiple I/O operations that can overlap

**❌ Not for**:
- CPU-intensive calculations
- Simple sequential scripts
- Operations that complete quickly

## Writing Your First Coroutine

A coroutine is an async function defined with `async def`. Let's create one:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    """Simple coroutine that simulates fetching data"""
    print("Starting fetch...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulates I/O delay
    print("Fetch complete!")
    return {"data": "example"}

# To run a coroutine, use asyncio.run()
result = asyncio.run(fetch_data())
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

**Output**:
```
Starting fetch...
(2 second pause)
Fetch complete!
Result: {'data': 'example'}
```

**Key Points**:
- `async def` creates a coroutine function
- `await` pauses execution until operation completes
- `asyncio.run()` executes the coroutine

### Why This Matters

Without async, this 2-second wait would block the entire program. With async, we can do other work during the wait.

## Running Multiple Tasks Concurrently

The real power of async emerges when running multiple operations concurrently:

```python
import asyncio
import time

async def fetch_url(url: str, delay: int):
    """Simulates fetching a URL with given delay"""
    print(f"Fetching {url}...")
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(f"Completed {url}")
    return f"Data from {url}"

async def main():
    """Fetch multiple URLs concurrently"""
    start = time.time()
    
    # Create tasks for concurrent execution
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(fetch_url("api.example.com/1", 2))
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(fetch_url("api.example.com/2", 3))
    task3 = asyncio.create_task(fetch_url("api.example.com/3", 1))
    
    # Wait for all tasks to complete
    results = await asyncio.gather(task1, task2, task3)
    
    elapsed = time.time() - start
    print(f"\nAll fetches completed in {elapsed:.1f} seconds")
    print(f"Results: {results}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Output**:
```
Fetching api.example.com/1...
Fetching api.example.com/2...
Fetching api.example.com/3...
Completed api.example.com/3
Completed api.example.com/1
Completed api.example.com/2

All fetches completed in 3.0 seconds
Results: ['Data from api.example.com/1', 'Data from api.example.com/2', 'Data from api.example.com/3']
```

**What Happened?**:
- Three "fetches" ran concurrently
- Total time: 3 seconds (the longest individual wait)
- Sequential execution would take 6 seconds (2+3+1)

**Key Points**:
- `asyncio.create_task()` starts concurrent execution
- `asyncio.gather()` waits for all tasks to complete
- Tasks run concurrently, not sequentially

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Use create_task() for Concurrency

**❌ Wrong** (runs sequentially):
```python
result1 = await fetch_url("url1", 2)
result2 = await fetch_url("url2", 2)
# Takes 4 seconds total
```

**✅ Correct** (runs concurrently):
```python
task1 = asyncio.create_task(fetch_url("url1", 2))
task2 = asyncio.create_task(fetch_url("url2", 2))
results = await asyncio.gather(task1, task2)
# Takes 2 seconds total
```

### 2. Use Async Context Managers

For resources like files or connections:

```python
async with aiofiles.open('data.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = await f.read()
# File automatically closed
```

### 3. Handle Errors in Tasks

```python
async def safe_fetch(url):
    try:
        return await fetch_url(url, 2)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching {url}: {e}")
        return None
```

### 4. Don't Block the Event Loop

**❌ Wrong** (blocks event loop):
```python
async def bad_example():
    time.sleep(2)  # Blocks everything!
```

**✅ Correct** (allows concurrency):
```python
async def good_example():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Allows other tasks to run
```

## Summary

You've learned the fundamentals of async/await in Python:

**Key Takeaways**:
- Use `async def` to create coroutines
- Use `await` to pause for async operations
- Use `asyncio.create_task()` for concurrent execution
- Use `asyncio.gather()` to wait for multiple tasks
- Async is for I/O-bound operations, not CPU-bound

**Next Steps**:
1. Practice writing your own coroutines
2. Try fetching real URLs with `aiohttp`
3. Explore error handling patterns
4. Learn about asyncio synchronization primitives

## Phase 3: Implement Basic Orchestration

### Step 3.1: Create Orchestration Test Script

Create `tests/test-orchestration.py`:

```python
"""
Test script for basic multi-agent orchestration
Simulates user request -> orchestrator -> specialists -> synthesis
"""

def simulate_user_request():
    """Simulates a user requesting work from the orchestrator"""
    task = {
        "type": "research_and_write",
        "topic": "Python Async/Await Best Practices",
        "requirements": {
            "research_depth": "comprehensive",
            "output_format": "tutorial",
            "audience": "intermediate developers",
            "include_code_examples": True
        },
        "quality_threshold": 80
    }
    
    print("=" * 60)
    print("USER REQUEST")
    print("=" * 60)
    print(f"Topic: {task['topic']}")
    print(f"Output: {task['requirements']['output_format']}")
    print(f"Audience: {task['requirements']['audience']}")
    print(f"Quality Threshold: {task['quality_threshold']}%")
    print()
    
    return task

def test_orchestration_flow():
    """
    Tests the full orchestration flow:
    1. User request
    2.
